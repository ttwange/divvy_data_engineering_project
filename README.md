# Divvy DBT Branch

This branch is dedicated to working on the Divvy DBT project before committing changes to the main branch. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this branch is to isolate development and testing of the Divvy DBT project from the main branch. It allows us to make changes, experiment, and collaborate on this specific feature without affecting the stability of the main branch.

## Workflow
1. **Development**: Working on changes related to the Divvy DBT project in this branch. I will create, modify, and test DBT models, SQL queries, and any associated code here.

2. **Testing**: I will nsure that changes work as expected. Test thoroughly to catch any issues or bugs.

3. **Collaboration**: Feel free to collaborate with me on this branch. Use pull requests for code reviews and discussions.

4. **Merging**: Once I am confident that changes are ready for production, I will create a pull request to merge this branch into the main branch. Ensure that all tests and reviews pass before merging.

5. **Cleanup**: After the merge, I can clean up this branch if it's no longer needed.

## Guidelines
- Follow best practices for writing clean and efficient DBT code.
- Document your changes and updates in the codebase as necessary.
- Coordinate with team members to avoid conflicts and duplication of efforts.
- Regularly update this README.md file with progress, status, and important information related to the Divvy DBT project in this branch.

- [DBT Documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction)
- [Git Flow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)

Remember, the main branch is for project-ready code, so let's work together to ensure that our changes are thoroughly tested and reviewed before merging. Happy coding!
